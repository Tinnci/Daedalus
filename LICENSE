GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use this
General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can use it for
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public License is designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if
you want it, that you can change software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of free software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) By asserting copyright on the software, and (2) offering you this
License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify
it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
developers' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise and persist in other domains, we stand
ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of
the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on universal computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid
the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it
effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents
cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to this GNU General Public License.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for copyright
infringement, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private
copy.  Propagation includes copying, redistribution, reverse engineering,
deobfuscation, or public display or performance of the work.

  To "convey" a work means any type of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not "conveying".

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list would suffice.

 1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a work in object code form, the "source
code" means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
compilation and installation of the executable.

  However, as a special exception, the Source Code distributed need not
include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or
binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of
the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form,
means the corresponding source code for all portions of the object code
that are covered by this License, plus the associated interface
definition files, if any, and the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the object code.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means the
Minimal Corresponding Source together with all the Interface Definition
Files that are included in the work's larger system.

  "Interface Definition Files" means source code files that as a mere
matter of convention define interfaces to programming by means of
declarations, not executable statements.

 2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, forming
part of a covered work, is inherited from the covered work.  (Consider
independent production of output not in scope of this License.)

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,
without any conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in
force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of
having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with
facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the
terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not
control copyright.  Those thusmaking or running the covered works for
you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and
control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your
copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under Article 11
of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar
laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of technological measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work to restrict the users' access to or exercise of
rights by means of said law.

 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms
of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

  a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
  it, and giving a relevant date.

  b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
  released under this License and any conditions added under section
  7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
  "keep intact all notices".

  c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
  License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This
  License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
  additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
  regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no
  permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
  invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

  d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
  "Appropriate Legal Notices"; however, if the Program has interactive
  interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
  work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and
which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or
on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate".  An aggregate does not require the other parts to be
covered by this License.

 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
Machine-Readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

  a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
  (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
  Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
  customarily used for software interchange.

  b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
  (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written
  offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you
  offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give
  anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the
  Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is
  covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily
  used for software interchange, for a price no more than your
  reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or
  (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at
  no charge.

  c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
  written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative
  is allowed only occasionally and non-commercially, and only if you
  received the object code with such an offer, in accord with section
  6b.

  d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place,
  and offer access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through
  the same place at no charge.  You need not require recipients to
  copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the
  place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding
  Source may be on a different server but you must provide clear
  indications where to find the latter.  An offer to provide
  Corresponding Source is required if you are part of the network
  where the object code is being offered, or if you received the
  object code through a proxy that offers you access to it, and you
  are in a position to convey the object code via a network server.

  e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
  you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source
  of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under
  section 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included
in conveying the object code work.

  A "System Library" means (a) anything other than the Work that (4) is
included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is
not part of that Major Component, and (2) serves only to enable use of
the Work with that Major Component, or to implement a standard interface
for which an implementation is available to the public in source code
form.  A "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential
component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating
system (if any) on which the Work runs, or a compiler used to produce
the Work, or an object code interpreter used to run the Work.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in non-source form must be
in the form of the complete Corresponding Source, and not intentionally
obfuscated, and must be publicly available at no more than a reasonable
reproduction cost.

 7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
"Excluded permissions" are terms that set aside exceptions within this
License that would otherwise be made.  An "at your option" stipulation
permits you to exercise your options as specified by the developer/author
when that option is granted.

  Upon conveyance of a covered work, you may sublicense the covered work
under this License, or apply additional permissions to it, provided that
you combine these with the License in a single set of terms. If you
combine these terms with the License in a single set of terms, you must
make it clear that each term is an "Additional permission" or "Excluded
permission" to the License.

  Notwithstanding the terms and conditions of this License, a covered
work, once released under this License, may be supplemented by other
terms as "Additional permissions" if they meet the following conditions:

  a) the Additional permissions are for the whole Work and are for the
  term of copyright on the Work;

  b) the Additional permissions allow use of the Work and its
  Derivative Works to promote the sale of any works created by
  or for you, or to allow use by or for you of any works created by
  or for you in the creation of other works (this is not limited
  to commercial purposes);

  c) the Additional permissions do not modify the conditions of this
  License, but merely provide additional functionality or enhance the
  user experience of the Work; and

  d) the Additional permissions are stated clearly and prominently in
  the Work, or within the documentation of the Work; and

  e) the Additional permissions do not require or allow use of
  a different license for the Work.

  These Additional permissions are optional, and you may choose to
exercise them or not. If you do not exercise them, you still have the
rights and obligations under this License, and you may convey the Work
under this License.

  If you convey the work under this License, you must ensure that all
copies of the work include an appropriate copyright notice, a copy of
this License, and any Additional permissions.

 8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the first
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by any reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.

 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to
receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However, nothing
other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any
covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept
this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work,
you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

 11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner of making,
using, or selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or
by causing, enabling, or inducing the foregoing.  For the purposes of
this definition, "control" includes the right to grant patent
sublicenses in accordance with the requirements of this License.

  A "contributor grant" is a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its covered work.

  In the current version of this License, a contributor grant is always
given and implied with each distribution.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may not
impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights
granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any
patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale,
or importing the Program or any portion of it.  This section does not
limit your right to bring an action for infringement of patent claims
which you do not yourself own or control, nor does it limit your right to
enter into patent license agreements or arrangements with third parties
that are not inconsistent with this License.

 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If you are faced with conditions (judicial order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, you may
not be excused from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations
under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a
consequence you may not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to
terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for conveying the Program,
the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would
be to refrain from conveying the Program.

 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under
version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License will apply to
the part which is the work licensed under the GNU Affero General Public
License.

 14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or
of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the
Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public
License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

 15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE
COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

 16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply the strongest disclaimer of all implied
warranties and limitation of liability possible that look in all legal
respects like the disclaimer and limitation of liability provided
herein.

                         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software that everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full license text is
located.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you about new issues.

For example, you might want to add a "wish list" section covering what
future versions of the program could include.

You can also add "moral obligations" to the GPL in your software by
displaying a clear statement about your values and principles.  For
example, see the GNU Emacs manual chapter "The Emacs Developers Code
of Conduct".
